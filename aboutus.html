               <h3 class="header mt-5 ">The Problem</h3>
               <p>During my days as a Student in the University, the prevalent challenge for me was accessibilty to quality and reliable learning materials. The School library was always filled to capacity and most of the time does not have the materials I need available.</p>
               <p>Because of this factor, I had to rely solely on the lecture notes/ handouts prepared by the course lecturer and this for Me was a problem because I like to read wide.</p>
               <h3 class="title-header">Rising to the challenge</h3>
               <p>After my graduation from the University, I decided to take up software engineering as a career, and even though I have worked for, and still working for Companies and Organizations, finding a solution to this problem has always been at the fore front of my career objectives.</p>

               <p>Because We believe in the power of Collaboration and Networking, GREENBRAIN is built to help you find and connect with Students in other Nigerian Universities who are studying the same course as you.</p>
               <h3 class="title-header ">The Goal</h3>
               <p>We are on a journey to create a platform which every Student in any Nigerian University can call home. A platform where we immortalize our amazing indeginous Lecturers by keeping their work alive and making sure their contributions lives on even long after they are gone. A platform that ensures this generation and the generation unborn can convinienlty gain access to learning materials with just a few clicks and at no cost.</p><br>
