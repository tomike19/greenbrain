               <h3 class="header mt-5 ">Free Learning materials</h3>
               <p>Users are able interactively access learning materials (i.e lecture notes, exam past questions and project materials) for free.</p>
               <p>In the case of lecture notes, users can add reviews/ updates to material and this update is publicly accessible to other users.</p>
               <p>For past question papers however, after viewing the material, users are able to attempt the questions and their solutions are also publicly accessible to anyone who might find the solutions useful.</p>
               <p>As for project materials, users are able to view the abstract, table of content and the complete chapter one for free.</p>
               <h3 class="title-header">Help your friends find their favorite materials</h3>
               <p>If you find a material in the repository and you think your friends might need it, you can easily bring it to their attention by way of recommending the material to them. You can only recommend to people in your connection (i.e followers or following)</p>
               <p>After my graduation from the University, I decided to take up software engineering as a career, and even though I have worked for, and still working for Companies and Organizations, finding a solution to this problem has always been at the fore front of my career objectives.</p>
               <h3 class="title-header">Let's make Money together</h3>
               <p>The project materials repository is open to all users to upload a project. The user is forever entitled to 50% of the project's worth everytime it is downloaded. And because there is no limit to the number of projects a user can uplaod, more materials means more money.</p><br>
               <p>The user will receive an automated email immidiadetly the project is downloadeded with instructions on how to claim his/her money.</p>
               <p>NOTE: You can download your project for free at anytime.</p>
               <h3 class="title-header">Stay on time with your lectures</h3>
               <p>Users are able to save their lecture timetables on their account for easy access. Now you don't have to remember which back of your notebooks carries your timetables.</p>
               <h3>All your results in one place</h3>
                <p>Users can securely store their academic results to their profile. The results are kept absolutely private so only you have access to them. Based on the results you saved here, greenbrain can automatically generate your GPA and your CGPA whenever you need it. Now you don't have to calculate them yourself.</p>
               <h3>Save all your jottings in the cloud</h3> 
                <p>Often times we forget where we wrote down a certain piece of information taken during lectures or personal studies or you simply misplaced the book and can't find it no more. Your friend probably borrowed it and failed to return it. These are all familiar cases, right?</p>
                <p>Worry no more because greenbrain lets you save your jottings and personal notes straight to the cloud and can be accessed anytime anywhere. Now you can't lose your jottings anymore and you can also share with your friends while still having a copy to yourself.</p>
